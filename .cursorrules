# Project: Snooker League Website

## Component Architecture
- We use a component-based approach for HTML.
- **Source Components**: Located in `/components/` (e.g., `header.html`, `footer.html`).
- **Implementation**: These components are pasted directly into final `.html` files.

## JavaScript Module Architecture
- We use a modular, component-based approach for JavaScript.
- **Configuration**: Located in `/assets/js/config/` (e.g., `sheets-config.js`).
- **Utilities**: Located in `/assets/js/utils/` (e.g., `csv-loader.js`, `formatters.js`).
- **Components**: Reusable JavaScript components in `/assets/js/components/` (e.g., `knockout-renderer.js`, `league-standings.js`).
- **Pages**: Page-specific modules in `/assets/js/pages/` (e.g., `index.js`, `fixtures.js`).
- **Entry Point**: Main router in `/assets/js/main.js`.
- **No Duplication**: Common code must be extracted to utilities or components, never duplicated.

## Rules for AI (Cursor)
1. **HTML Syncing**: Whenever I ask to update the "Header" or "Footer," always update the code in the `/components/` folder first, then propagate to all `.html` files.
2. **JavaScript Organization**: When adding or modifying JavaScript functionality:
   - Update shared utilities in `/assets/js/utils/` first
   - Update reusable components in `/assets/js/components/` for shared UI logic
   - Update page-specific modules in `/assets/js/pages/` for page logic
   - Never duplicate code - extract common patterns to utilities/components
3. **Google Sheets Configuration**: To change the Google Sheet, only update `/assets/js/config/sheets-config.js` - this is the single source of truth.
4. **Script Loading Order**: Scripts must be loaded in this order: config → utils → components → pages → main.js
5. **Relative Paths**: Always use relative paths (e.g., `assets/css/style.css`, not `/assets/css/style.css`).
6. **No absolute URLs**: Never include `http://localhost` or drive letters like `C:/Users/`.
